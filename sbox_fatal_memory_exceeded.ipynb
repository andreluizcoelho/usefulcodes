    "The code above works nicely also. It makes a .py file from the .ipynb without having to open the jupyter notebook. If I tried to open the original notebook .ipynb file to download it as .py file, it would crash before even loading it, so the code above can be a good option. If you want to see other options that might also work for you, here it [is](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#convert-script). Do not forget that a .ipynb file is a JSON file, another way is to open the ipynb file as a JSON file, and copy the lines of code you want from the ipynb file.

The first three cells with the lines of code are in markdown because they shall be typed inside the command prompt (Anaconda Prompt is preferred). And the last cell above must be typed inside the jupyter notebook input cell instead of the command prompt as the other lines of code, but it's as markdown because the JSON file from my .ipynb file is enormous and it has restricted information; I also tested the code and it works fine.
